# virtual-resume-developer

## Description
For my project manamgnet course, I created a virtual resume developer. In theory, this would be a website that the end user would fill our pertinant invormation related to a proffesional resume, upon submission of the form, they wold be presented with a website and a unique link to give to employers. In practice, the current website is in its infancey and is just a demo.  

## How to
To use this demo simply run index.html in your browser. Hovering over the menu button will present a list of options from which to choose. 
##### "Begin Buliding" 
This page presents the user with a form to fill out personal invomrattion that would usuallt be found within a normal resume document.
##### "Help" (incomplete)
This page will present the users with a list of detailed instructions on how to use the website and developer. 
##### "Who are we?" (incomplete)
This page will give the users an understanding of the develpoers and designers behind the project. 
##### "Resume Examples"
This page presents the user with an exmaple output of the Virtual Resume Developer.

## Looking Ahead
In the final version of this project, a backend will be developed to save user infomartion as well as create a unique url for them. This would be a paid serive that would include hosting for the site on a month-to-month pricing model.
